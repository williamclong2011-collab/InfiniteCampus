maybe replace the rules system with a list of services that each role can access
example for the admin server page the rules would be like this
the roles before the services will be for who actually has access to see the page
AdminServerPage: {
    isOwner:true,
    isTester:true,
    isCoOwner:true,
    isHAdmin:true,
    isDev:true,
    isAdmin:true,
    services: {
        logs: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isHAdmin:true,
            isDev:true,
            isAdmin:true
        },
        uploadsLockdown: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isDev:true
        },
        discordLockdown: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isDev:true
        },
        moviesLockdown: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isDev:true
        },
        chatLockdown: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isDev:true
        },
        restart: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isDev:true
        },
        uploadLogs: {
            isOwner:true,
            isTester:true,
            isCoOwner:true,
            isHAdmin: true,
            isDev:true
        }
    }
}
services that a user does not have access to should be hidden on the frontend.

Also, i want a system where i can create new roles and assign them to people like discord.
